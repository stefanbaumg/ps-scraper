Logging is a simple way to let your application describe its health and operations in a way that is readily consumable by both you and software, and it can provide significant insight when working out bugs. Log4net is one of the most used logging libraries for the .NET platform, with a proven track record going back to 2001. This course is aimed at getting you up and running with log4net, starting with answering the common configuration questions and moving through the entire log4net stack. Included in the course are discussions of effective and advanced logging tactics, such as applying logging through common design patterns and Aspect-Oriented programming. In addition the course demonstrates how you can tap into the modular log4net architecture and extend it with your own code.">Application Instrumentation using log4net</a>

We use some custom caches based on Azure Table Storage and disk shares, and you&#39;ll see how to set up ASP.NET Output Caching to use different solution caches. You&#39;ll learn how to add caching outside the solution with HTTP response headers so consumers of your website and API can cache solution resources locally, and reduce traffic to your servers. Finally, you&#39;ll learn how to analyze items to configure them for maximum cache effectiveness, how to control items in caches, and how to measure the performance improvements you get from caching.">Caching in the .NET Stack: Inside-Out</a>

There&#39;s enough stuff out there in the development world to keep us both excited and overwhelmed. Learning new tech has become easier with the all the information available to us, especially in the way of these Pluralsight courses. But learning how to use a technology and learning how to properly implement it or integrate it with other technologies can be a whole different ballgame. Service-Oriented systems have become mainstream, but designing applications in a service-oriented fashion requires a different look on the components that make it up as well as technologies to support the architecture. This course will bring it all together for you by building on knowledge you have on technologies like WCF, Web API, ASP.NET MVC, WPF, and Knockout and going from A to Z on the architecture, design, development, and testing of a complete system. And this system will not only use a multitude of technologies in the middle-tier, but will also be consumed by different UI clients on the web and the desktop. Know how to write services in WCF and Web API, but want to see some real-world implementation from both MVC and WPF clients? This course is for you. Want to know how to implement dependency injection from the middle tier to the various UIs? This course is for you. Want to write decoupled, testable software? This course is for you. The final set of applications can be used as a skeleton and framework for any SOA-based system you write going forward, and the techniques used in its development will become part of your development arsenal forever.">Building End-to-End Multi-Client Service Oriented Applications</a>

ASP.NET 2.0 applications can take advantage of ASP.NET Ajax&#39;s server-side features to further enhance their UIs, often through simple markup.

Learn how to efficiently optimize your website resources and assets without comprising the way you want to develop. ASP.NET makes bundling and minification incredibly easy and leaves no reason not to ensure your web application is fully optimized. Walk through basic optimization setup against a demo application in both Web Forms and MVC. Then, work to enhance the demo application by adapting the bundling framework for ignoring files, ordering files, and adding CDN scripts with a fallback. You will see how to begin extending the optimization library with your own custom transforms to harness great flexibility. We will take customizations a step further and consider using custom bundles to consolidate and inject resources, enumerations and templates to the client. Finally, we will dive into unit testing your optimization configurations and extensions and the importance of doing so in a team environment.">ASP.NET Bundling, Minification & Resource Optimization</a>

This course will teach you how to implement OData query support and OData formatting for round-trip CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations on resource collections exposed using Web API services. You will first learn some fundamentals about ASP.NET Web API services, REST, and OData. Then you will learn about OData query syntax and how to easily implement it in your services. Then you will learn how to define Entity Data Models to support the full OData navigation syntaxes, and add OData formatters to turn your services into fully compliant OData services. Finally you will get some exposure to calling those services from .NET and JavaScript clients.">Building ASP.NET Web API OData Services</a>

If you have existing ASP.NET Web Services you are trying to support, you may have realized that it can be difficult to find good information about using them today. In this course you will learn the basics of ASP.NET Web Services and how to use them. We&#39;ll start off by talking about the technology and learning about how ASP.NET Web Services work. Then, we&#39;ll dive in and create our own simple ASP.NET Web Service and learn about how the technology works. Once we have a web service built, we&#39;ll learn how to use .NET&#39;s proxy generating utilities to create a consumer for our web service without writing much code. After that, we&#39;ll learn how to use ASP.NET Web Service in an existing ASP.NET application to provide AJAX functionality and even see how we can embed service methods in ASPX page. Finally, in the last module, I&#39;ll take you through the process of converting a legacy ASP.NET Web Service to newer technologies like WCF and Web API. So, if you need to maintain an existing legacy ASP.NET Web Service application or you are looking to learn enough about ASP.NET Web Service to feel confident in migrating to a newer technology, you&#39;ll want to check out this course.">Introduction to ASP.NET Web Services</a>

Next, you’ll explore what&#39;s new with data binding (some significant features have been added here) including model binding and strongly typed data controls. You’ll also see enhancements that have been made to the ASP.NET framework such as bundling and minification of JavaScript and CSS, asynchronous modules and handlers, SignalR and more. Several new HTML5 features are also demonstrated including new HTML5 input types, Web Sockets and support for multiple file uploads. The course concludes with a look at important security-related improvements in ASP.NET including support for OAuth, request validation and support for preventing cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks.">New Features in ASP.NET 4.5</a>

In this course, John will show you how to use the Unity IoC container in an ASP.NET MVC 4 application to use dependency injection on controllers, filters, views and more. You’ll start off by learning the basics of IoC containers, how they work and why they are important. As well as, learning about how internally ASP.NET MVC 4 creates controllers and views. In order to understand practically how dependency injection works (the core function of IoC containers)John will walk you through manually doing dependency injection in ASP.NET MVC 4 using your own custom controller factory. After you have done things manually, you’ll see how to add the Microsoft Unity IoC container to your MVC 4 application to do dependency injection automatically. Essentially you&#39;ll see how it is able to give us more flexibility and reduce the custom code we need to write. John then takes things even further by exploring some advanced dependency injection techniques using Unity to inject views and filters. He’ll also cover some of the advanced features of the Unity IoC container. Finally, you’ll take a tour through some other popular .NET IoC containers and see how to get them working in our ASP.NET MVC 4 application. After taking this course you will be equipped with the skills and knowledge you need to build real applications using Inversion of Control and dependency injection.">Practical IoC With ASP.NET MVC 4</a>

We start slow by understanding the need for real-time apps and existing technologies, before unpacking SignalR in all its glory. We take a look at SignalR usage in building real-time connected web applications, before turning to client mobile apps. Windows Phone, Windows 8, HTML5, iOS and Android - all join the fun. Locations apps, Mapping, Chat, Live Game Scores, Object syncs - you name it, we got you covered with real-time apps! Come join me in this course as we explore some of these new real-time opportunities through demos and detailed code samples.">SignalR Across Web and Devices</a>

Glimpse is an amazing open source and free diagnostics platform for the web. Glimpse lets you see diagnostics information about what is happening on your server directly in your page through a small diagnostics window completely rendered in JavaScript. Out of the box, Glimpse can show you all kinds of information about your MVC application, like what routes are registered, what the flow was through the MVC pipeline and how the models were bound. In this course I walk you through getting Glimpse set up in your application. Then, I show you how to use the Glimpse tabs to understand what is going on in your ASP.NET application. After that, I&#39;ll take you through the very useful ASP.NET MVC tabs and show you how to diagnose a real problem in an ASP.NET MVC 4 application using glimpse. Once we learn all about Glimpse, it&#39;s time to learn about plugins. In the last two modules of the course, I first show you how to install and use some of the common Glimpse plugins, then I show you how easy it is to actually create your own Glimpse plugin. So, if you are an ASP.NET developer and you haven&#39;t heard of Glimpse, you&#39;ll definitely want to check out this course. It will be well worth your time. And if you have heard about Glimpse, but haven&#39;t felt like you have had the time to learn how to use it, this course will help you to become a Glimpse expert and learn everything you need to know to start using Glimpse in just a few hours.">Using Glimpse With ASP.NET, MVC4, and Entity Framework</a>

It is not easy to pull together all the different technologies required to build an API or distributed service, because there are so many choices. ServiceStack makes things much simpler by providing a convention-based &quot;stack&quot; of services that allow you to build a clean service-based API using standard web service formats and protocols, without having to worry about all of the infrastructure needed to provide it. This course explains what ServiceStack is, and how you can use it as an alternative to ASP.NET MVC, Web API and WCF for quickly building elegant and speedy applications that can run on just about any platform. If you want a simple convention-based approach for building services and APIs in .NET, and you want it all in one package, you may be interested in checking out this course.">Using ServiceStack to Build APIs</a>

Perhaps you already know some Java, but you&#39;ve never build a complete Android application before. Either way, this course has you covered! In this course, you will learn the basics of Java and Android while you create a real working Android application. This course is the third course in a 4 part series on beginning Android development, but you don&#39;t need to watch the other courses to understand this one. As long as you have some basic programming knowledge, you should be able to follow along with this course and build your first Android application using Java and Eclipse. In this course we&#39;ll alternate between learning and doing as we set out to build a note taking application for Android. We&#39;ll start off covering everything you need to know about getting setup to develop an Android application in Java using Eclipse. Then we&#39;ll create our Note Taker application step by step, clearly explaining each step as we go and introducing Java concepts along the way. If you are looking for a new and fun way to learn Java while building an Android application, or you are just looking to maximize your time, by learning two topics at the same time, this course might be just what you are looking for.">Android Beginner Series: Just Enough Java</a>

Perhaps you are brand new to the world of programming and want to learn how to program quickly while doing something fun like developing an Android app? If so, this brand new course series might be just what you are looking for. This is the first course in a series of 4 courses designed to take you from knowing nothing about Android and very little about programming in general to building your own Android apps and games. Here is a breakdown of the courses: course 1: Understanding Android - this course; course 2: Creating Android Apps Without Code Using App Inventor; course 3: Just Enough Java To Build An Android App; course 4: Building a Simple Game In Android. In this first course, we take a look at the very basics of Android and learn exactly what Android is and how it works. This course will go over the design and history of Android. Then we&#39;ll take a look at what exactly an operating system is so that we can better understand the Android operating system and how it works. After that we&#39;ll go over Android applications and exactly what makes them unique. And we&#39;ll finish up the course by talking about all the different ways you can develop Android applications and how the Android app markets work. By the time you finish this course, you should have a solid foundation in Android fundamentals and be ready to start learning how to develop Android applications in the upcoming courses in this series. Whatever your level of programming experience, this course series will get you building your own apps and games in Android quickly, and we&#39;ll have fun doing it. And even if you are already an Android developer, you may find the in depth understanding of how Android works that you will learn from this course valuable.">Android Beginner Series: Understanding Android</a>

In this course, you will take on the role of a cadet in the illustrious Pluralsight Space Academy. Our drill instructors and teaching staff will school you in game mechanics as they verbally &quot;encourage&quot; you in this fast paced Android game programing course. This course will take you through the process of creating a space shooter game in Android step by step using the popular libGDX library. Even if you have no interest in Android, you can still watch the course and build a Java based cross platform game. This course is course 4 in the 4 part series on beginning Android development, so this course will assume you already know some Java, but because this course uses a cross platform game library, knowing much about Android is not required. Even if you haven&#39;t watched the other 3 courses in this series, you can still watch this course and learn how to create an Android game in Java. So, are you up for the challenge cadet?

Don&#39;t know Java, don&#39;t know C#, never programmed before? No problem! In this course, you will learn how to use MIT&#39;s App Inventor to create four fully functional apps without writing any code. Along the way, you&#39;ll learn some basic programming concepts that will help you gain the skills you need to be able to program in a language like Java. We&#39;ll start off by learning about App Inventor and how to get it setup. Next, we&#39;ll jump right in and create the follow four real applications: (1) a number guessing game; (2) a simple drawing program; (3) an RPG character creator; (4) Irritated Dolphins (our Angry Birds-like game). If you are looking to get started with Android programming, or programming in general, this course will offer you a gentle introduction to many Android and basic programming concepts and make it fun and easy to learn. And if you are already an experienced developer, but are interested in checking out App Inventor, you&#39;ll probably find this course useful and fun as well. This course is the 2nd course in a four part series on beginner Android development, where we go from not knowing how to code to building real Android application in Java.">Learning to Build Apps with App Inventor</a>

The second part explains the most essential techniques that you will come across in your projects. However, to better understand how these techniques can be used in your real projects, they are explained in the context of a Payment Gateway scenario driven from a real project.

You will take a lap around all of these tools and you will learn when to use which. In this demo-heavy course, the very same report will be built with each of these tools so you can see the strengths and weaknesses of each of them with your own eyes.

In this course, I’ll take you through the complete process of creating an application that works on each of the platforms and uses a REST based backend API to share data and business logic—all using C#. We’ll start off this course by learning how to build a REST based API using the popular open source framework ServiceStack. I’ll show you how easy it is to get ServiceStack set up and even how to store data for the API using a Redis database. Next, I’ll show you how to create an ASP.NET MVC 4 application that uses the REST service we built to display it&#39;s data and implement it&#39;s logic. We’ll learn how to use JQuery to make AJAX calls to a REST based API from within our MVC 4 application. Then, we’ll learn how we can use C# and the .NET framework to build an Android application using the Xamarin tools. We’ll use the same REST API, we created earlier and build a real native Android application that is able to consume that API for implementing its logic and displaying data. Finally, I’ll show you how to do the same thing for an iOS application. We’ll again use C# to build a real native iOS application with the Xamarin tools and learn how to consume REST based web services from iOS. So, if you are a C# developer and don’t want to have to learn several other programming languages to build cross platform applications; you’ll definitely want to check out this course. By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills you need to be able to implement an end-to-end cross platform solution complete with a REST based API backend all in C#.">An MVC4, iOS And Android App With ServiceStack, Xamarin and C#</a>

This course covers object-oriented programming, functional programming, the dynamic language runtime, LINQ programming, and software craftsmanship.">C# Fundamentals - Part 2</a>

I’ll be using the principles of “modern C++” as much as possible, relying on the Standard Library and using idioms like Resource Acquisition is Initialization to reduce the effort involved in memory management.

A quick overview of the Standard Library will provide you with collections, algorithms to work with collections, and string manipulation capabilities, as well as signposts to more Standard Library capabilities. Then perhaps the most important C++11 language change, lambdas, are explained and put in context. Finally exceptions, a powerful error-handling technique, are introduced and you will see their significance for resource and memory management. With the modern C++ foundations complete, the last module of this course goes back in time to the sorts of syntax and idioms you&#39;re likely to find in older code, including typedefs, function pointers, void pointers, and C-style strings and arrays. Modern C++ developers must cope with legacy code and this module will show you how.">C++ Fundamentals - Part 2</a>

Blogging, Twitter, Github, StackOverflow, User Groups and Conferences: all of this can make you a happier, more productive developer and inspire you to take your career to the next level. You certainly don&#39;t have to be social to be better at writing code - but sharpening your skills this way helps you when it comes time for a job interview, a yearly review where a promotion is on the line, or when you want to start running an Open Source project. For this production we sought out the people who are very active and well known in the social arena: Scott Hanselman and Jeff Atwood talk about blogging, writing, and &quot;working your voice free&quot; so people who read your posts hear you loud and clear. Jon Skeet joins us to talk about what a Good Question is on StackOverflow - and also how you can gain reputation by providing Good Answers - and edits to Good Questions! We venture out to the Portland Area DotNet Users Group (PADNUG) and meet a few developers who have just started going - as well as people who have been there for years. While we were there, Scott gave a 10-minute lightning talk on Azure - a great way to get started speaking if you&#39;re not a fan of public speaking.">Get Involved!</a>

When you need a job, it is important to have good job interviewing skills and know what to expect. The only problem is, it is very difficult to get experience with job interviews, because we don&#39;t do them that often. This course is designed to make you feel much more prepared for a developer job interview by going over the process and talking about many of the types of questions you are likely to encounter. In this course we&#39;ll go over the basics of a job interview and talk about specifically what employers are looking for and how you can improve your resume. I&#39;ll teach you some tricks that increase the chances of you getting an interview greatly. We&#39;ll also go over one of the most difficult and scary parts of a developer job interview, solving a coding question on the spot. I&#39;ll walk you through my own personal technique for solving these types of problem and take you step by step through an example, so that you can gain the skills and experience that will help you feel comfortable to tackle these kinds of problems on your own. Our journey will then takes us through some typical interview questions to help you understand what types of thing you should know and prepare for and the best way to answer these types of questions. Then we&#39;ll go through a blazing fast boot camp for computer science questions about data structures, algorithms, bit manipulation, and concurrency... All the fun stuff you forgot about from college. And finally we&#39;ll wrap up by talking about how you can get experience if you don&#39;t have any, and what kind of experience is valuable. If you are looking for a job currently or just want to brush up on your skills to be prepared, this course might be just for you.">Preparing For a Job Interview</a>

Or puzzled over a time when your code added two floating point numbers but the result wasn&#39;t quite correct? If so, then this is the course for you. It aims to teach you the mathematics behind how computers store and manipulate numbers and booleans. You&#39;ll learn, amongst other things, how to read binary and hexadecimal numbers, and why floating point numbers are almost always stored with small errors and how to estimate how big those errors are. You&#39;ll find out how to simplify complex logical expressions, or how to use logical operators and bitwise flags to very efficiently store and manipulate sets of true/false properties. The course also features lots of advice on best practices for working with numerical and boolean data. Underpinning all this, you&#39;ll learn how to see your data the way a computer sees it. And that, when your job involves writing or debugging code that manipulates millions of bytes of data, is a very useful skill to have.">Math For Programmers</a>

The previous introductory course, &quot;Introduction to Machine Learning with ENCOG 3,&quot; laid out a solid foundation of machine learning and neural networks. This course will build upon that foundation for more advanced machine learning implementations. In this course, you will learn about various neural network optimization techniques to overcome the problems of underfitting and overfitting and to create more accurate predictive models. This course will also provide an overall picture of various neural network architectures and reasons for their existence. This course will be focused towards implementation of various supervised feed forward and feedback networks. During the whole course, we will be using open source machine learning framework ENCOG to implement various concepts discussed in this course. Although the implementations in this course are ENCOG-based, concepts discussed in this course are widely applicable in other frameworks or even in custom development.">Advanced Machine Learning With ENCOG</a>

What about setting breakpoints that automatically trigger whenever an AJAX call is made, or whenever a specific element on a page is modified? You can do all this and more with the Chrome Developer Tools, and in this course I&#39;ll show you how. If you&#39;ve seen the Chrome Developer Tools, but just not had the time to really dig into them, or you get the feeling that you are only scratching the surface of what the Chrome Developer Tools can do, this course might be exactly what you need to take your web development abilities to the next level. I&#39;ve found that many web developers are only aware of the basic features of the Chrome Developer Tools, so I&#39;ve structured this course to go over just about every inch of the tools and explain clearly what they do and how you can use them. In this course we&#39;ll cover every one of the 8 panels that exist in the Chrome Developer Tools toolbar. We&#39;ll start off by going over the function of the console, giving you the ability to modify JavaScript objects interactively on the page, debug issues and add helpful log messages with ease. Then, we&#39;ll take a trip to the elements panel where we&#39;ll be seeing how to modify HTML and CSS styles and see the effects immediately displayed on the page. After that, we&#39;ll check out the network panel and how to find out exactly what resources our pages are getting from the network, how long it is taking to get them, and what order all of this is happening in. Then, we&#39;ll head over to the sources panel and unveil the powerful built-in JavaScript debugging capabilities that Chrome has out of the box. (You won&#39;t want to miss this part.) We&#39;ll follow up with a quick review of the audits panel to see how it can give us some handy optimization tips for our pages. Then we&#39;ll dig into the timeline panel where we&#39;ll learn how to figure out exactly what is happening when a page is being displayed and how to optimize our pages to ensure the animation is never choppy. Finally, we&#39;ll wrap things up by seeing how the profiles panel can help us quickly identify performance problems with JavaScript or CSS selectors and also let us see into the scary realm of JavaScript memory management. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to really dig into the Chrome Developer Tools and see what all they can do, that time has come!">Using The Chrome Developer Tools</a>

Knowing how to solve problems and optimize performance by modifying the Eclipse.ini can be a life-saver. However, you need to be armed with some basic knowledge. If Eclipse doesn’t do everything you need in your workflow, chances are good you can find a plug-in that will add any critical missing functionality.

Chrome also has a very good extensibility model that allows developers with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to create powerful extensions. In this course, I’ll show you the basics of creating Chrome extensions as we create 3 different Chrome extensions. We’ll start off the course learning a little bit about the basics of Chrome extensions and how extensions work in Chrome and then we’ll dive right in and start creating our first extension. Once we have the basics down, we’ll build a more powerful extension that has its own user interface and options page and is able to save data using the Chrome APIs and add its own entry to the right click menu for Chrome. Then, we’ll learn to create a page action extension which will only show up on certain web pages. We’ll also learn how to utilize the Chrome messaging API and even how to inject our own JavaScript and CSS into an existing page to enhance its capabilities. We’ll actually have our extension modify the Pluralsight website course listing page to make the course listing table sortable—so, you won’t want to miss this. Finally, we’ll wrap up our tour of Chrome extensions by learning how to debug extensions as well as deploy them. So, if you are interested in Chrome extensions, but have always thought it might be too difficult to create one for yourself, you definitely need to check out this course. Trust me, it is much easier than you probably think and this course will show you how to do it.">Creating A Chrome Extension</a>

Which processor should you select? How can you avoid having to pay exorbitant amounts for licenses, or wasting money through over-provisioning a server? This course answers all these questions and more. The course begins be explaining basic server terminology, and then explains how to decode Dell and HP server model numbers, along with Intel and AMD processor numbers so you can figure out what current servers and components you have. It then describes and demonstrates the common application, processor, memory, and disk benchmarks you can use to evaluate the performance of your current and new servers. After that, it explains all the choices you need to make when choosing a new server so that you make the best use of your hardware budget, considering the anticipated workload plus OS and application licensing limitations. Finally it covers how to maintain your servers, including how to limit maintenance downtime using high-availability technology, and then how to maximize your hardware budget through negotiation tactics, consolidation, and virtualization. This course is perfect for beginners with little knowledge of server hardware, through developers, DBAs, managers, and other IT professionals who need to understand how to successfully evaluate and provision new servers">Understanding Server Hardware</a>

In this course I&#39;ll walk you through the creation of a real application using the Kinect. We&#39;ll be building a Fruit Ninja clone called Shape Ninja which will be capable of detecting chopping gestures and responding to audio commands. We&#39;ll start off by learning a little bit about the Kinect itself and the Kinect SDK. Then, I&#39;ll show you just how easy it is to get color image and depth data from the Kinect. We&#39;ll make our application be able to detect and respond to a chopping gesture. And, we&#39;ll wrap things up by learning how to use the Microsoft Speech Platform SDK in combination with the Kinect&#39;s audio sensors to implement real voice commands for our application. If you&#39;ve been waiting for the opportunity to check out the Kinect, but you didn&#39;t know where to start or perhaps you thought it would be difficult to learn, this course will get you up and running with the Kinect in no time.">Building a Real Application With Kinect</a>

The Leap Motion is a new type of user interface device that allows for very precise tracking of up close motions. The Leap Motion opens up the possibility for creating completely different kinds of applications that are able to be controlled by fingers, hand gestures and even tools like a pencil. This course will teach you everything you need to know to get started developing application for Leap Motion in C#. First you’ll learn a bit about motion tracking in general and how the Leap Motion works. We’ll discuss how the Leap Motion device is unique from many other motion tracking technologies. Then, we’ll go through the basics of the Leap Motion itself and you’ll learn how to get started and setup your development environment for developing a Leap Motion application. After that, we’ll take you through the process of creating a real WPF application that uses the Leap Motion controller for tracking movement. You’ll learn how to use the Leap Motion SDK to create code to track individual finger movements and gestures and how to map those movements to screen coordinates to control an object on the screen. Finally, we’ll take you through the process of bringing your Leap Motion application to the masses as we show you how to deploy your application to the Leap Motion Airspace store. By the end of this course, you’ll have built a complete application that can be controller with a Leap Motion controller.">Developing for Leap Motion in C#</a>

And it is actually much easier than you think, especially now that you can develop games completely using web technologies you probably are already familiar with. Modern browsers today that have support for HTML5 and fast JavaScript engines are more than capable of running complex games that would have been impossible years earlier. In this course, I’ll show you how to create a complete game using only HTML5 and JavaScript. We’ll start off by learning the basics of game development and the basics of how HTML5 and modern browser technologies support it. Then, we’ll dive right in and start implementing the basics of a game. We’ll start off by actually creating the start of a game completely from scratch, implementing everything ourselves. Once we’ve seen the basics of doing things from scratch, we’ll introduce a JavaScript game engine to help us out as we learn about Quintus and start building our first real complete game. From there on we’ll expand our game little by little as we add features like moving a player around and firing shots in the game. We’ll also learn how to create enemies in the game and give them some intelligence. So, if you are interested in game development or if you just want to see what is possible with HTML5, check out this course. You’ll be surprised how easily you can put together a real HTML5 game.">Beginning HTML 5 Game Development With Quintus</a>

In this course I’ll teach you the basics of Firefox OS and show you by example how to create two real Firefox OS applications as well as how to get those applications into the Firefox Marketplace. In this course, we’ll start off by learning a little bit about Firefox OS and what makes it different. We’ll also talk about some of the benefits of a mobile operating system that uses web technologies you are already familiar with and take a quick look at the OS itself. After that, we’ll create a very basic Hello World application as we go through the pretty simple process of installing the Firefox OS simulator and creating a very basic application to run inside it. Once we have those basics down, we’ll go straight into creating our first application. First, I’ll show you how to create a hosted application which is an application that you can actually host on your own webserver, but is installed like any other mobile app on Firefox OS. Then, we’ll create another full application, as we learn how to create a packaged application that is able to access more of the APIs that Firefox OS only exposed to apps that are actually installed on the device. We’ll still use the same HTML 5 technologies you are used to for this application, but we won’t need to host the app ourselves, because the user will install in directly on their device. Finally, I’ll take you through the process of deploying your Firefox OS applications. We’ll talk about the different options you have for getting our application into users hands including distributing it yourself and using the Firefox Marketplace to host your apps. So, if you are excited about mobile, and want to learn about an exciting platform you can develop for that will allow you to reuse your existing HTML 5, JavaScript and CSS skills, you’ll definitely want to check out this course.">Beginning HTML5 Apps For Firefox OS</a>

From a programming standpoint, it just worked. With ever-growing fragmentation, shifting standards, and lack of Flash support on mobile devices, the industry is currently in flux. HTML5 has emerged as an open source alternative to Flash for video playback, with a growing feature set, support across mobile, and an energized developer community surrounding it. HTML5 is really still in its infancy (well, perhaps adolescence) and its features are still not on par with Flash. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a good way to play video online. In this course, I’ll show you how to achieve the same basic video-related tasks in Flash and in HTML5. Through simple side-by-side examples, you’ll be able to compare the technologies and see the strengths and weaknesses of each, and hopefully remove a few bumps from your transition path.">Taking The Leap from Flash to HTML5 Video</a>

The architecture also facilitates replacing built in functionality with our own implementations. Support for HttpModules and HttpHandlers allow the web server to be extended using familiar managed .NET code rather than the previous ISAPI techiniques that required unmanaged C or C++. Great new diagnostic features provide the ability to save information about failed requests and allow inspection of worker processes and active requests running in the web server. The Microsoft.Web.Administration can also be used to write managed code that can create IIS web sites, application pools, or virtual directories.">Extending IIS 7.5 with Modules and Handlers</a>

But, it doesn’t have to be a painful experience. In this course, I’ll show you the basics of creating an iOS application as we build a complete iOS application learning what we need to know about Objective-C along the way. We’ll start out by learning a little bit about iOS in general and the iOS development environment. Then, we’ll jump right in and create out first Hello World iOS application as we set up our development environment and learn the basics of the IDE we use for iOS development, Xcode. After that, I’ll show you the core things you need to know to build any application, how to build a user interface and interact with it. We’ll learn how to use Xcode’s Interface Builder tool to create a very basic IU and interact with it. Once we’ve got the basics covered, we’ll start building our first real application. We’ll learn a few new concepts as we build our application, like how to use the iOS storyboarding feature to creating a multi-screen application and how to setup navigation in our application. Finally, we’ll finish up our iOS application by learning how to add user settings to the app and how to show the user a simple notification through the use of alerts. So, if you are looking to get started with iOS development and are looking for an easy and gentle way to get introduced to the environment and tools while building a real application, this course is exactly what you need. You won’t be an expert at iOS development after taking this course, but this course will definitely give you a head start in learning the platform and show you the basics you need to know before taking a more advanced course.">Beginning iOS 7 Development</a>

                    <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/hibernate-introduction" title="In the world of Java, one of the most popular and widely used frameworks is Hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM, or Object Relational Mapper, that allows developers to map Java objects to relational database tables. It is a valuable tool that all Java developers should know how to use. The problem is, learning Hibernate can be difficult. Hibernate is a very large framework and there are many important concepts to understand to use it effectively. This course is designed to make getting started with Hibernate as easy as possible and focus on the most important things you need to know. We start off this course by learning a bit about Hibernate and how it works, and then see how to get it setup with a real MySQL database installation. After that, we learn the very basics of mapping, which is one of the most important things to understand about Hibernate. I&#39;ll show you how to create a basic mapping for a Java object to a relational table and explain to you how the mapping works. But most real world applications have more complex mapping that often trips up new developers and experienced developers alike. So, we&#39;ll also cover some of the complex mapping situations like mapping collections and different relational mappings like one-to-many and many-to-one. Once you&#39;ve learned how to map you objects, you&#39;ll want to know how to query them, so I&#39;ll show you how to do this using Hibernate&#39;s built in HQL and using a more object oriented approach with the Criteria API. Finally, we&#39;ll wrap things up by taking a brief tour of some of the more advanced features like caching and interceptors. So, if you are wanting to learn how to use Hibernate, or if you&#39;ve been struggling through using Hibernate in an existing application, but never really understood what was going on, this course will give you the knowledge you need to feel confident about how Hibernate works and how to use it.">Introduction To Hibernate</a>

Do you have constant battles between the .NET side and the Java side, because of the competition between the two? Perhaps you just have to work in both environments and wish there was a way to reuse some of your code from Java in .NET or .NET code in Java? This course will give you solutions to help with all of those problems. In this course we&#39;ll take a look at how you can make your Java and .NET code talk by utilizing 3 different technologies. First, we&#39;ll use IKVM.NET to convert Java directly to .NET, which will allow you to use Java libraries in your .NET applications and even write Java applications in .NET. Then, we&#39;ll use JNBridgePro to bridge directly between .NET and Java and allow you to communicate between .NET and Java applications while still running each in their own environment. Finally, I&#39;ll introduce you to RabbitMQ for creating a message based service that allows for not only Java and .NET to interoperate, but also any other language that can send messages to RabbitMQ. So, if you&#39;ve been considering rewrite a Java application as a .NET application or a .NET application as a Java application, but have been thinking there has to be a better way, this course might be just what you are looking for. Or if you are in an environment where both Java and .NET are used, but seldom talk to each other, this course can help you to learn about tools you can use to get both sides talking, letting you walk away a hero.">Making Java And C# Work Together: JVM and .NET CLR Interop</a>

You will learn how to use Angular with current technologies like MVC and the Web API, and legacy technologies like Webforms and Web Services. You will learn how to shift your way of thinking to go from just using a little bit of JavaScript here and there, to take advantage of all that Angular has to offer the .NET developer. Whether that means just putting a little bit of angular on a page or two in your site, or building an entire Single Page Application. Topics include how to organize and maintain your code, how to integrate Angular into ASP.NET pages, how to communicate with both current gen and legacy technology servers, how to work with real time services using SignalR, and how to prep and deliver your code to the client efficiently. By the end of this course you will feel comfortable adding either a little or a lot of Angular to your ASP.NET project.">AngularJS for .NET Developers</a>

You&#39;ll need to query web services to retrieve the data for presentation, let the user edit the data, and push those changes to the server. And if you are going for a rich, stateful, interactive user experience, you won&#39;t want to be doing full page post backs to get that done. To work with the data on the client side, you&#39;ll need change tracking and validation of edits, the ability to filter, sort, and page data from the client side. You might need to work with that data offline as well. Breeze.js is a JavaScript library that does all of that for you. Breeze lets you quickly develop a good layered architecture on the client side in JavaScript, acting as a data layer, repository, or data gateway for your client side code. This course will walk you through all of the core features of Breeze. You&#39;ll learn how to execute queries from your client side JavaScript to retrieve data for presentation, work with the cached data on the client side, enable rich editing scenarios, handle changes to the data client side, validate that data, and send changes back to the server side. You&#39;ll see how to set up the services using ASP.NET Web APIs and how to work with OData services.">Building Data-Centric Single Page Apps with Breeze</a>

Unfortunately, since Meteor is so new, there isn’t a large amount of information available to learn how to develop applications with it. This course is designed to take you through the full process of developing a complete single page application in Meteor using JavaScript and deploying that application to a real production system. We’ll start off by learning about what Meteor is and learning about the technologies that Meteor uses. Then, we’ll dig deep into Meteor to demystify the “magic” around it and discover how Meteor is able to do so much with so little code. Then, we’ll actually create our first Meteor application and along the way we’ll cover some of the code concepts of Meteor needed to create a basic Meteor application. Once we have the basics down, we’ll expand our application and discover some of the more advanced concepts of the platform that really allows us to utilize the power of Meteor. Finally, we’ll go beyond Meteor as we learn how to deploy our application to both the Meteor servers and a Linux machine in the cloud and also discover how to use community created extensions to do things like add routing to our application. So, if you are interested in Meteor and want to see how you can create single page applications entirely in JavaScript with relatively little code, compared to other solutions, check out this course.">Meteor.js Fundamentals for Single Page Applications</a>

It&#39;s time to learn it right! Javascript is a highly dynamic language with many interesting features which most developers never learn. Yet familiarity with Javascript is a must if you want to develop current web applications with the full power of modern browsers. The Prototype.js library makes Javascript nearly painless. It extends native objects with extra functionality and makes it easy to organize your code or even extend built-in objects. If you&#39;re a Rails developer, it&#39;s time to learn the magic behind the Javascript libraries that ship with Rails. You may even find yourself taking advantage of the power or Prototype instead of using the Rails helpers that insulate you from the process! If you want to use Prototype with another server-side framework, you&#39;ll learn the client-side basics you need to be confident with Ajax.">Prototype.js Fundamentals</a>

Learn to leverage jQuery to move beyond simply selecting and manipulating DOM nodes. Some of the many topics covered include: authoring plugins for internal projects and for publication, improving performance of DOM node selection and insertion, customizing jQuery to add more defaults and named constants, using the data method to store and retrieve arbitrary data associated with DOM nodes, manipulating arrays and collections with jQuery&#39;s built-in utility methods, and handling events correctly even for dynamically created DOM nodes. This course also includes a comprehensive coverage of deferred objects and promises based on CommonJS. Code examples are given for most of the covered concepts.">jQuery Advanced Topics</a>

Even though there are many solutions today for cross platform development on these platforms, many of the solutions either require you to use a single non-native user interface or create your user interface code multiple times. Appcelerator Titanium is an exciting way to build truly native Android and iOS applications using JavaScript which are able to reuse a large amount of code, even for the user interface. In this course, I&#39;ll take you through the process of getting setup with Appcelerator Titanium and fill you in on all the details of how exactly Titanium works and why it is so different than many other cross platform solutions. Throughout this course, we&#39;ll actually build a real mobile application that will run on both Android and iOS using Appcelerator Titanium and along the way learn about the platform and how to use it. We&#39;ll start off learning how to programmatically create a cross platform user interface in JavaScript and how to interact with the user interface and respond to events like button clicks. Then, we&#39;ll learn a bit about the different platform APIs that Titanium provides and how to expand our app to take into account multiple screens. After that, we&#39;ll learn about Alloy, a way to build Titanium applications using XML markup and style sheets using an MVC or Model View Controller approach, which can greatly simplify our code and make it much easier to design an application. Finally, in the last module, we&#39;ll tackle a few advanced concepts and learn about the awesome Titanium Cloud API, which allows us to create a full backend for our application without having to install any databases or design any complex schemas. So, if you are interested in cross platform application development and you&#39;d like to see how you can build truly cross platform native applications using JavaScript, you&#39;ll definitely want to check out this course.">Cross Platform Android and iOS Apps With Appcelerator Titanium</a>

This involves understanding Spanning Tree Protocol, which is a simple solution to prevent layer 2 loops, yet can create complex topologies, and potentially a slow converging network, which can cause issues for our users. We will look at how Spanning Tree Protocol operates, and then examine how it converges on a real network. Then we dive into looking at how we can modify the Spanning Tree Protocol topology, and improve performance. Additionally in this series, we will perform an IOS upgrade on a router and a switch, and even cover how to fix an upgrade gone really bad. Also, you will learn how to change the password on a router or switch, when you do not know the password.">Cisco CCNA: Advanced Ethernet and File Management</a>

Next we look at using Node to write both client and server web applications, as well as real time integration with Socket.IO. We cover writing unit tests using both the built-in assert module and third party frameworks.

Node.js makes it easy to write asynchronous, event-driven applications that serve static, dynamic, and persistent data to clients while using a minimum amount of RAM and CPU time. While other programming environments can accomplish similar things, Node has been built from the ground up to make this kind of programming painless. In this course, you&#39;ll learn to install, use, and understand Node by building a real-time geographical tracking system (live demo).

He was one of the first users and contributors to Node.js. He started howtonode.org where many people learned how to use early versions of Node.js. He now works at Cloud9, a browser-based IDE. He has authored over a hundred open source projects. We gave Tim the task of building a simple function that parses directions, durations, and distances from a set of instructions for trail hikers. He built a simple Node.js web app to demonstrate the feature. You&#39;ll see Tim work with: lightweight, high performance Node.js web servers (his final app runs in only 1ms!), building middleware, writing a test suite with built-in modules, using Apache bench for benchmarking, adding structure to an application as it develops, debugging, and the good feeling of writing Open Source software.">Play by Play: Tim Caswell</a>

A lot of developers find Redis is very different than relational databases like SQL Server or Oracle and even quite different than other NoSQL databases like MongoDB or RavenDB. In this course, you will begin to understand exactly what Redis is and how Redis works. You will walk through 5 data structures of Redis that will help you to understand how each data structure works and when you might use it. John will show you how to install Redis, both on a Windows machine for learning and testing and on a real Linux server for production use. You&#39;ll also learn about the ServiceStack.Redis C# client for accessing Redis from C# code. Finally, John will take you through the process of creating a real application with Redis and ASP.NET MVC4 as we put what we learned into practice. The purpose of this course is to take you from being hesitant to learning this database, to confident in building a complete application using Redis as a backend.">Building NoSQL Apps With Redis</a>

In Module 1, we cover basic DBA tasks using just PowerShell. With Module 2, we provide an introduction to the two main tools for working with SQL Server, the SMO, or SQL Management Objects, and the SQL Server Provider. Module 3 will cover basic DBA tasks using both SMO and the SQL Provider. With Module 4 we switch to Developer mode and cover development using the SQL Provider. Module 5 continues the developer theme, this time using the SQL Management Objects. We finally wrap things up with Module 6, in which we go over a real world example of using PowerShell and SQL Server. We also cover the SQL PS mode of PowerShell, as well as how to make effective use of PowerShell from a SQL Server job.">PowerShell and SQL Server</a>

The central design mantra in PowerShell is Think-Type-Get. That is: Think what you want, Type it, and Get the results. Unfortunately this mantra doesn&#39;t always work - PowerShell combines concepts from other languages (Perl, Python, and VBScript for example) and borrows ideas from other platforms (like pipelining in Bash). This creates an experience that feels familiar, but fails to behave consistently with our experiences. This creates &quot;gotchas&quot;. In this course, we will analyze some specific cases of PowerShell&#39;s strange behavior in order to better understand how and why PowerShell works the way it does.">PowerShell Gotchas</a>

Many developers are surprised to find that even very popular games like Angry Birds are written in Lua. In this course, you’ll learn how to quickly get started writing programs and scripts with Lua. I’ll take you through the basics of Lua, show you some tricks that demonstrate the Lua’s flexibility and even show you how to use Lua in an object oriented way. We’ll start off in this course by learning a bit about Lua itself and Lua’s history, as well as learn how to download Lua and use the popular SciTE IDE for creating and running Lua code. After we are setup and ready to develop some Lua code, we’ll learn the basics of Lua as we jump right in and build our first application. We’ll go over Lua’s type system and learn how to assign variables, utilize operators, use conditional logic and create loops. Once we’ve got the basics covered, we’ll explore two powerful concepts in Lua: functions and tables. We’ll learn how functions work in Lua and what makes them so powerful, and we’ll see how tables can be used for more than just storing simple data. Even though Lua itself doesn’t have a class construct, we’ll learn how to do object oriented programming in Lua using tables and metatables. Finally, we’ll wrap up the course by learning a little bit about the standard libraries that come with Lua. I’ll show you some examples of using some of the most useful functions in the standard libraries and show you where you can get more information about them.">Beginning Lua</a>

                    <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/introduction-building-web-applications-dart" title="Dart is an exciting new programming language from Google which is designed to eventually replace JavaScript. Dart is an optionally typed language, meaning that it can be as dynamic as JavaScript, but it also has a type system which can give you the benefits of languages like C# and Java. In fact, you&#39;ll find that if you already know Java or C#, Dart will seem very familiar to you, since it takes some of the best features of those languages and much of their syntax. Many C# and Java developers find they can start writing Dart code with a very short learning curve. You&#39;ll also find that you can start using Dart right now, because Dart code can compile down to standard JavaScript which can run anywhere. In this course, I&#39;ll take you through Dart and the Dart platform, and show you the basics of the language. We&#39;ll quickly go over the language itself in a single module and then we&#39;ll jump right in to building a real web application with Dart and the Dart libraries. You&#39;ll learn how to add Dart code to a web page in a very similar fashion that you probably have been doing with JavaScript. You&#39;ll also see the power of the Dart language and libraries as we explore some of the advanced data binding and templating features in the Dart Web UI library. We&#39;ll wrap up the course by going over some of the advanced features of Dart, like concurrency using isolates instead of threads, and mixins that allow us to get the benefits of inheritance without many of the drawbacks. So, if you&#39;ve been interested in Dart, but haven&#39;t wanted to invest the time into learning a whole new programming language, this course will show you how much about the Dart language you probably already know and get you building a real application quickly. The goal of this course is to make it as easy and painless as possible to get started with Dart and decide if it is something you want to learn more about.">Introduction To Building Web Applications With Dart</a>

We&#39;ll progressively cover each important concept in the language and finally end by looking at concurrency (which is built into the language.) If you are looking for an extremely fast an efficient language that is an elegant replacement for traditional systems programming languages like C or C++, Go might be just what you are looking for. Go allows you many of the benefits of powerful low level languages, but is very easy to use and designed with today&#39;s programming environment in mind.

                    <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/python-fundamentals" title="Python Fundamentals gets you started with Python, a dynamic language popular for web development, big data, science and scripting. What’s so great about Python? Python is powerful. The Python language is expressive and productive, it comes with a great standard library, and it’s the center of a huge universe of wonderful third-party libraries. With Python you can build everything from simple scripts to complex applications, you can do it quickly, and you can do it with fewer lines of code than you might think possible. But for many people those reasons take back-seat to something more important: Python is fun! Python’s readable style, quick edit-and-run development cycle, and “batteries included” philosophy mean that you can sit down and enjoy writing code rather than fighting compilers and thorny syntax. As your experiments become prototypes and your prototypes become products, Python makes the experience of writing software not just easier but truly enjoyable. In the words of Randall Munroe, &quot;Come join us! Programming is fun again!&quot;">Python Fundamentals</a>

Ben then reads and understands the test code, then rewrites it to be clearer and more maintainable. He then sets his sights on the implementation code where he changes a bit of the API, then tackles a particularly terse method. The result is a dozen insights into when, where, and how to refactor code confidently. This isn&#39;t a rehearsed presentation, but a live discovery of code for the first time. If you&#39;re not confident with refactoring, you&#39;ll learn a ton from this video. If you are, you&#39;ll see how another expert does it.">Play by Play: Ben Orenstein</a>

In about 80 minutes, he writes a prototype for retrieving data and serializing it for use on a client. In the second part, he finishes the project started in Part 1 by building a front end for a scoring system using Ember.js. In about an hour, he builds a search field that retrieves data from the server, calculates a score, and displays it. Note - this course uses an ancient version of Ember.js.

They have a website they want to probe for security risks – this is how they go about it. This approach is more reflective of the real online threat than reviewing source code is and it empowers developers to begin immediately assessing their applications even when they&#39;re running in a live environment without access to the source.

IN addition students will also learn how SharePoint 2007 integrates with ASP.NET 2.0.">SharePoint 2007 Developer Ramp-Up - Part 2</a>

Most of the pages you see in a typical SharePoint site have one or more web parts on them. Needless to say, developing custom web parts is one of the more common tasks given to a SharePoint developer and likely how they were introduced to SharePoint development in the first place. This course examines web part development from asking, “What are web parts?” to looking at how to connect two web parts using ASP.NET Ajax. Whether you are new to building web parts or you have some experience under your belt, you’ll find tips and techniques in this course to help you become a more effective web part developer.">SharePoint 2010 Web Part Development</a>

It’s taken a while but we’re starting to see this shift in the SharePoint development space as well. To support developers who want to do more on the client-side and to make it possible to build interesting applications using the SharePoint 2013 App Model, Microsoft has made significant enhancements to both the Client Object Model (CSOM) and the REST API. This course covers the fundamental use of these APIs, discusses how they have evolved in SharePoint 2013, and highlights many of the their new features.">SharePoint 2013 Development: Client Object Model and REST API</a>

In the first two modules, you&#39;ll get a jump start on PowerShell where you&#39;ll learn everything from basic syntax to creating functions and scripts, all within the context of SharePoint. Next, you&#39;ll discover what&#39;s new when it comes to using PowerShell V3 with SharePoint 2013. Administering SharePoint with PowerShell does not mean that you&#39;re limited to what you can do directly on the server, and in this course you&#39;ll learn everything you need to know to manage your Farm remotely, whether you are using Office 365 or an on-premises installation. And finally, sometimes the out of the box cmdlets just aren&#39;t enough - so we&#39;ll teach you how to create your own custom cmdlets that you can deploy to your SharePoint Farm. After completing this course, you&#39;ll be on your way to becoming a SharePoint superstar, with the core knowledge you need to start administering and automating SharePoint using Windows PowerShell.">Using Windows PowerShell with SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013</a>

In this course we will try to tear apart that question and get to the nuance that lies within.We will use computing history to learn from past mistakes and triumphs. We will then look into the advantages and flaws of the technology behind the Web and native platforms. We quickly bisect the fact that there are two sides to the question: Using the Web as a delivery platform? Or, as an experience platform? At Walmart Labs we have gone through these challenges, so we use our own example to add to other case studies to give an overview of the problem and how you can hope to use the Web and native together more as peanut butter and jelly.">Web vs Apps: The Big Picture</a>

This course will dive into the problem with estimation in projects today and then a complete overview of the concept of agile estimation and the notion of re-estimation. We’ll learn about user stories, story points, planning poker , product backlog, team velocity, how to apply them all to estimation and iterative re-estimation. We will then take an alternative approach and look at using real metrics to limit the guesswork in estimating and still run a team that produces predictably and reliably. The course will round out with a discussion on how to “sell” the concept of Agile Estimation in various environments such as consulting or fixed cost projects. Upon completion of this course you will be able to perform Agile Estimation in your organization.">Agile Estimation</a>

This course discusses when abstractions are justified and outlines the merits of various approaches for structuring applications with a pragmatic, real-world mind set. The discussion begins by outlining philosophies for thinking about architecture and considering the benefits of doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. Then we dive into various design patterns and technologies to consider within the business, service, presentation and data access layers. And in the final capstone module we&#39;ll consider two specific architectures and discuss the contexts where each makes sense. You&#39;ll learn when table module, active record, DDD, and ORMs are useful and walk away with the tools to better evaluate and justify complexity as an agile software craftsman.

This course is about how you could hold regular &quot;Coding Dojo&quot; meetings where you and your team can focus on improving your practical coding skills together. You&#39;ll be practicing in a safe, collaborative environment, using simple &quot;Code Kata&quot; examples. It becomes a space away from your normal work, where you can discuss coding practices like Test Driven Development and Refactoring, then later bring your new skills to bear in your production code. This course should give you; the coding dojo organizer, the supporting materials you need to start a Coding Dojo, and get everyone who attends to practice better software development techniques. It should also allow you to improve your communication and facilitation skills, and help your team to gel. Kent Beck once said &quot;I&#39;m not a great programmer, I&#39;m just a good programmer with great habits&quot;. What are you doing to improve your coding habits?

                    <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/creating-acceptance-test-fitnesse" title="Creating acceptance tests can be difficult in software development, because often a developer has to translate business requirements into coded tests. Many times some of what needs to be tested and how it needs to be tested gets lost in the translation. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier if the business person or QA person could just create the test cases themselves and still have them automated? FitNesse is a great testing framework that allows you to do just that. Using FitNesse, a developer creates test fixtures that allow non-technical people to write tests just by modifying a Wiki page. In this course I&#39;ll walk you through the steps to get set up and running with FitNesse. I&#39;ll show you how to use the older Fit style of creating test and the newer Slim style and we&#39;ll cover both Java and .NET, since FitNesse can work with either platform. FitNesse itself happens to be a Wiki, so it is also an excellent tool for documenting a system and the tests that go with it in a format that changes with the system. So if you&#39;ve been thinking about learning about an acceptance test framework, or you&#39;ve been wanted to learn FitNesse, but have always thought it had a steep learning curve, this course will help you to get started quickly and understand how FitNesse works.">Creating Acceptance Tests With FitNesse</a>

You also need to know how to build an automation framework that can support creating tests that are not so fragile that they constantly break. This is the real key to success in any automation effort. In this course, I will reveal every secret I know from creating several successful automation frameworks and consulting on the creation of others. I will show you exactly, step-by-step how to create your own automation framework and I will explain to you the reasoning behind everything we are doing, so you can apply what you learn to your own framework. We’ll start off this course by going over the basics of automation and talking about why it is so important as well as discuss some of the common reasons for success and failure. Then, I’ll take you into the architecture of an automation framework and show you why you need to pay careful attention to the structure of any framework you build and give you some of the underlying design principles I use when creating an automation framework. After that we’ll be ready to start creating a framework. In the next few modules, I’ll show you how to create a real automation framework capable of automating the Wordpress blogging platform administrative console. We’ll start off by creating smoke tests and using those smoke tests to build out our initial framework. Then, we’ll expand the capabilities of our framework as we create more tests and learn how to use techniques like dummy data generators to make our tests as simple and easy to read as possible. Finally, I’ll take you through some best practices and tips that cover topics like scaling out, working in Agile environments and other important issues you are likely to face. If you are responsible for an automation project for a web application or you want to start using automation, you’ll definitely want to check this course out.">Creating an Automated Testing Framework With Selenium</a>

Finally, we&#39;ll see how Dependency Injection Containers can provide benefits that would be difficult to implement ourselves. This just scratches the surface.

We&#39;ll cover installing Jenkins, configuring Jenkins and getting a basic job running. Once we are confident in the basic functionality of Jenkins we&#39;ll move on and talk about all the plugins that are available and how you might use them. Finally, we&#39;ll take a look at the big picture and show you what you can really do with Jenkins. Along the way I&#39;ll give you some great tips that will help you pick the best plugins for Jenkins and give you some good strategies for successfully bringing you build system into Jenkins with little headache. By the end of this course you should feel confident installing Jenkins and setting up basic jobs. You should also have a clear picture of what you can do with Jenkins and how to expand its capabilities.

                    <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/uml-introduction" title="Seldom does a software project of any size get built by only one person. Most often many different people, with different skills work together to build the solution. It is not uncommon to have the technology not be the most challenging part of the project, but rather it is often the lack of clear communication between the project team members. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) helps the team members to communicate clearly and precisely. The UML includes several diagrams and models that support the design of different aspects of the solution. If each member of the team is able to understand those models that are useful to them they are more likely to understand each other, and the challenges and risks of different understandings and views of the solution are minimized. In this course we review the need for this clear communication. We discuss several of the common diagrams that teams use to model a software solution and identify some of the team members that most commonly use the diagram. The UML is very large and there is much that can be done with it beyond what is covered in this introductory course. But having this basic understanding of the common models can reduce many of the challenges faced by project teams.">Introduction to UML</a>

Either way, this course will teach you what you need to know to not only get started with JUnit, but to master all of the features of the JUnit framework. In this course, we&#39;ll start out by learning the basics of JUnit and how to create some basic unit tests. Then, we&#39;ll go into some of the lesser known advanced features of JUnit that will really help you write elegant tests with less code. After that, I&#39;ll show you how to integrate JUnit with your existing Ant or Maven build system and how you can automate the creation of JUnit reports. Finally, we&#39;ll wrap things up by going beyond the basic uses of JUnit by learning how to use stubs and mocks to really isolate classes and we&#39;ll also learn how to use JUnit for more than just unit testing. By the end of this course, you&#39;ll be a JUnit pro and will have a handful of useful tools and techniques you can use to make the most of the JUnit framework.

It begins by showing how to use Mercurial as a local, stand-alone source control system. Then it introduces working with a Mercurial server by showing how to get files into and out of a hosted repository. Finally it shows how to create and merge branches. Topics covered include source control, distributed version control, branching, cloning and merging. After viewing this course, the viewer should have the basic skills necessary to evaluate Mercurial as a replacement for their existing version control system, or to be productive using Mercurial if joining a team already using it.">Mercurial Fundamentals</a>

One of the simplest ways to implement database maintenance is to use the built-in Maintenance Plan functionality to schedule the critical database maintenance tasks - backups, consistency checking, statistics maintenance and index maintenance. The course starts by explaining how to configure Database Mail, and Operator, and alerts, all within SQL Server Agent. It then describes all the commonly-required maintenance tasks and shows how to configure them, along with do&#39;s and don&#39;ts, plus some of the less commonly used tasks. After that it shows how to pull these tasks together into Maintenance Plans using the Maintenance Plan Wizard, the Maintenance Plan Designer, and through Integration Services packages. Finally the course discusses some of the alternative methods of implementing database maintenance through freely-available scripts. This course is perfect for anyone who is responsible for SQL Server databases, with any level of experience, from SQL Server 2005 onward.">SQL Server: Maintenance Plans</a>

It then explains and demonstrates numerous aspects of T-SQL coding where choices can be made to make the code and application more efficient, and avoid common performance pitfalls. Application and code testing is then addressed, along with figuring out the hardware, software, and SQL Server requirements that must be communicated to the users. The course ends by walking through the deployment phase, including common SQL Server and database configuration options that must be changed or left as the default value, and explaining how to ensure that application and database upgrades run smoothly.

We first look at how the shift in technology trends established the need for a different breed of technologies. Columnar, or Column-Oriented, databases have become increasingly popular in data warehousing applications because they allow for better compression and multi-fold performance improvements, and we&#39;ll see how SQL Server 2014 implements this with clustered columnstore indexes. In addition, as technology makes a bigger shift in hardware to multi-core CPU architectures and large amounts of memory are even cheaper and more attainable, it&#39;s important for software to adjust and utilize these changes. We&#39;ll see how In-Memory OLTP addresses these trends and more, letting you create tables in memory, eliminating locks and implementing optimistic multi-version concurrency. This course discusses in depth In-Memory OLTP (memory optimized tables), previously known as Hekaton. We&#39;ll cover creating memory-optimized tables, loading data, durability and the affect that has on the transaction log. We&#39;ll also look at indexing in detail, explaining the new index types created specifically to support In-Memory OLTP and how and when to apply each type based on your use case and we&#39;ll discuss how In-Memory OLTP and Clustered Columnstore indexes can fit a variety of applications while comparing them with each other and traditional disk-based tables and indexes.">Optimizing OLTP and Data Warehousing with SQL Server 2014</a>

This course explains how to create a performance baseline for a SQL Server instance using benchmarking techniques. The course begins by exploring the reasons for benchmarking and baselining, along with how to decide what to capture, when and how often to capture it, and where to store it. It then explains how to use the Performance Monitor tool in detail, along with how to capture query information using SQL Trace and Extended Events, and then analyze that information using the free Clear Trace and ReadTrace tools. After that it describes and demonstrates the multitude of Dynamic Management Views that can be used to gather information about SQL Server, before ending with a summary that pulls all the modules together. This course is perfect for those with no experience of benchmarking and baselining, and those with some experience but who want to solidify their understanding of creating and using benchmarks and baselines.

                    <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/sqlserver-logging" title="The logging and recovery mechanism is one of the most misunderstood parts of SQL Server, but it&#39;s one of the most critical for you to understand. There are a lot of log management problems you can run into that can cause workload performance problems and even application outages. This comprehensive course, written by someone who has actually worked on the SQL Server logging and recovery code itself, explains everything practical there is to know about how logging and recovery work, and how to avoid and recover from problems with the transaction log. The course follows a building-blocks approach, starting with a simple definition and example of how logging is used, and then covering transaction log architecture and log recorss themselves. Using this knowledge, the course then moves into details of checkpoint operations, general transaction log operations including log clearing and VLF management, and how recovery and crash recovery work. The three recovery models are described in detail, as well as how to create and configure transaction logs for optimal performance, including monitoring transaction log performance. The course ends with a detailed module on transaction log backups, tail-of-the-log-backups, and examining transaction log contents, and then a module on dealing with transaction log corruption and how logging and recovery are used in high-availability technologies. The course is perfect for anyone who has to manage SQL Server and wants to avoid common transaction log problems, as well as those looking for in-depth coverage of everything to do with the transaction log. The information in the course applies to all versions from SQL Server 2005 onwards.">SQL Server: Logging, Recovery, and the Transaction Log</a>

Knowing when to use each method is important and understanding how SQL Server works will demystify certain behaviors you may have seen but previously have been unable to explain. SQL Server can support any workload, any design, and any data requests but knowing exactly which one is the most beneficial to use can give you better long-term scalability, availability, and performance. Using the wrong method can cause more memory to be wasted and even result in parameter sniffing problems (where subsequent statements perform poorly because of the plan that’s been cached). This course will show you how each statement execution method works, how it’s cached, whether or not it wastes cache, and finally how to test and rewrite the statement to take better advantage of caching. Along the way we will also cover a variety of other necessary features and tools: estimates, statistics, and heuristics; how to analyze query plans; some indexing strategies to improve performance; and plan guides. This course is an absolute must for everyone that works with SQL Server and it’s also an introduction to concepts that will be built upon in future courses. This course is applicable to all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for SQL Server developers as well as anyone responsible for writing data access statements to SQL Server tables. You can have any level of experience to gain from this course but those of you who have experienced what seemed odd behavior/performance with your ad hoc statements will probably benefit the most!">SQL Server: Optimizing Ad Hoc Statement Performance</a>

Often the poor query plan is chosen because the cardinality estimate is wrong - the estimate by the query processor of how many table rows will be involved in the query. This course shows you how to recognize when the query processor has an incorrect estimate, along with explaining and showing a multitude of possible causes, plus how to fix them. The course starts with explaining why query plan quality is important, and then shows how to easily spot cardinality estimate issues from examining query plans. The majority of the course shows all the possible causes of cardinality estimates being incorrect along with how to fix them, and more than 25 demos to walk you through practical examples of the concepts and problems in the lectures. This course is perfect for developers, DBAs, and anyone responsible for performance tuning on SQL Server. The information in the course applies to all version from SQL Server 2005 onwards.">SQL Server: Troubleshooting Query Plan Quality Issues</a>

The course begins by explaining how virtualization works under the covers and why virtualization has become so popular. It then discusses the various memory, CPU, and storage considerations that must be taken into account when virtualizing SQL Server, and demonstrates how to properly configure virtual machines for use with SQL Server. Next the course discusses the high availability and disaster recovery options that VMware and Hyper-V provide, plus how to back up virtual machines. Finally the course shows how to monitor and improve virtual machine guest and host performance in VMware and Hyper-V, and discusses some of the limitations that could prevent a SQL Server workload from being successfully virtualized.

Choosing the right data types when you&#39;re designing your columns, tables, and indexes is really critical. Using the wrong data type can cause more space to be required, affecting data density in memory, database and backup size, transaction log efficiency, and more. It&#39;s even more important when you&#39;re choosing your clustering keys, as the wrong choice there can cause nonclustered index sizes to balloon dramatically. It can even affect the performance of queries, when incompatible data types are used in comparisons and cause very costly operations to take place. This course will show you how to make the right choices and avoid all of these problems. It starts by explaining the various data structures that are used to store columns and rows, and how they can be affected by data type choice. Then it shows how data type choice factors into clustered and nonclustered index key choice. Finally it describes the implicit conversion and probe residual problems that can occur from mismatched data types used in queries. Packed with a wealth of information and practical, easy-to-follow demonstrations, this course will show you how to make the RIGHT choices to make sure you avoid all these common problems. The course is applicable for all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for SQL Server developers and anyone responsible for designing and creating SQL Server tables and indexes, with any level of experience.">SQL Server: Why Physical Database Design Matters</a>

The SQL Server: Detecting and Correcting Database Corruption course showed you what you need to know to detect and recover from most cases of database corruption and this course will take you to the next level of knowledge and capabilities. The course starts by explaining in depth how DBCC CHECKDB processes databases and how you can tune the performance of DBCC CHECKDB to make it run as fast as possible. You&#39;ll then learn about some undocumented DBCC commands, such as DBCC PAGE and DBCC WRITEPAGE, which can be invaluable when investigating and repairing corruption. The course then moves on to dealing with transaction log corruption, such as using EMERGENCY mode and how to re-attach damaged databases, and more advanced restore techniques, including how to analyze the transaction log to find the point to restore to and how to perform a tail-of-the-log backup using a different SQL Server instance. Finally, the course ends with advanced repair techniques, including how to deal with corrupt metadata by manually editing system tables, how to salvage data from backups and nonclustered indexes, and the ultimate in advanced recovery techniques: manually editing a database using DBCC WRITEPAGE. Packed with a wealth of information and practical, easy-to-follow demonstrations, this course will prepare you for dealing with out-of-the-ordinary corruption problems. The course is applicable to all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for more experienced SQL Server professionals.">SQL Server: Advanced Corruption Recovery Techniques</a>

Mercurial is not only fast, it also provides a smooth transition for developers who are already comfortable with Subversion&#39;s basic command set. And it gives you easy access to common functionality without resorting to cryptic command-line flags. It works well on all major operating systems, including Microsoft Windows. Learn it quickly with our Mercurial tutorial! Major projects such as Python and Mozilla use Mercurial. Project hosting options abound, including Google Code, BitBucket, and even GitHub via the experimental hg-git! In this course, Dan Benjamin draws on years of experience with source code control systems to get you up to speed with Mercurial. In fact, he was so impressed with Mercurial that he converted all his personal projects and is now using it daily. Even if you primarily use Git or another distributed system, this course will help you for those times when you want to clone or contribute to a project hosted in Mercurial. And maybe you&#39;ll even learn some tips to take back to your SCM of choice.">Meet Mercurial</a>

Rather than focusing solely on aesthetics, he considers the context of the existing site and thinks through how his designs fit into the average user&#39;s workflow. In this course, he designs a prototype for a theoretical feature at PeepCode: a bulk video download system. Kyle will walk through: thinking through a UI problem, using aesthetic and workflow context when designing a new feature, using small tools together for collaborating on designs (Skitch, Campfire, Preview, Photoshop), designing just enough detail for the first iteration of a feature, educating users about new features, finding the sweet spot between functionality and simplicity. Kyle spends most of his time in Photoshop and the Webkit web inspector. Both designers and developers will benefit from watching how he works.">Play by Play: Kyle Neath</a>

He was one of the first people to experiment with writing mobile-specific web applications for the iPhone. In this live session, we asked him to design a mobile UI for a theoretical trail hiking directions application. Neven shows that experienced designers and developers go far beyond merely learning the latest software APIs or using the newest features of hardware. He applies his skills of analysis toward understanding the task, then finds relevant language to communicate the direction in which he wants to take it. Neven is not only a skilled designer, he&#39;s also an eloquent teacher. In about an hour and 45 minutes, you&#39;ll hear him talk through his design process and explain the decisions he makes along the way.">Play by Play: Neven Mrgan</a>

We gave him a small task and watched him design a user interface out loud and on paper. The result is possibly the most insightful, educational, and thought provoking video we&#39;ve produced so far. In this 72 minute video, you&#39;ll watch Ryan sketch out a user interface for a single page of a web application. He doesn&#39;t write any code (that comes next), but he thinks through the issues and follows several possible paths before coming to rest on a solution. You&#39;ll benefit from watching him learn about the problem domain, evaluate his own ideas, and combine user interface metaphors into a plan for a prototype. He describes his process as clearly as he thinks about it, which makes for a great video whether you&#39;re a front-end designer or a back-end programmer. First, Ryan teaches about sketching and thinking through the problem. Then Ryan implements a prototype in HTML and CSS.">Play by Play: Ryan Singer</a>

In this series, we give talented developers a project and talk through it as they design and develop in real time for about 2 hours. Although neither John nor Ward are graphic designers, they are skilled software developers all the way from the backend database to the front end user experience. In this live session, they discuss project requirements with a client, then go deep into exploring possibilities for the application&#39;s screens, buttons, text, and workflow. At the end they begin coding a prototype with AngularJS. Whether you are a designer, a developer, or a project manager, you&#39;ll appreciate their wise insights and their skills in pulling a problem apart to see how a solution will work in the hands of the end user. Along the way you&#39;ll appreciate their sense of humor and camaraderie as they think through this problem out loud.

Often they need to take over projects for which no database code can be found. Then once they&#39;ve created code, they have to track changes manually in order to provide the DBA with change scripts. All the while thinking, &quot;there&#39;s got to be a better way!&quot; Fear not .Net Developer, it&#39;s Data Dude to the rescue! Originally code named &quot;Data Dude&quot;, Visual Studio Database Projects havef gone through several name changes since it&#39;s inception with VS 2005. In Visual Studio 2010 it became another project type, a Database Project. In this series you will learn how to harness the power of the Database Project to create a new database, or reverse engineer the code for an existing database. You will learn how to refactor, and let Visual Studio keep track of the changes, to let it automatically generate change and deployment scripts. Finally, you&#39;ll learn how to take advantage of Visual Studio&#39;s powerful data generation capabilities to create realistic test data.">Visual Studio 2010 Database Projects</a>

Moreover, an easier task is to transaction-enable .NET applications. .NET provides you with the classes to do just that. If that is the case, then why a course about transactions? Well, that is because just like everything else in programming, you need to understand the architecture, the underground of whatever seems to be an easy task. Only then can you design solutions as opposed to only coding them. WCF transactions are built from ground up around .NET transactions. This is hardly surprising anyway, since WCF is a .NET technology. However, this sums up as follows: you need to understand how .NET does transactions in order to utilize them in WCF.">Understanding .NET and WCF Transactions</a>

                    <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/building-windows-store-business-applications-prism" title="When building client business applications for WinRT and the Windows Store in XAML you need to design your application for maintainability and testability. To achieve this, you need to design your application following principles of separation of concerns and loose coupling, which usually means employing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern in XAML. In addition, you have to learn how to leverage the new features of the Windows Runtime (WinRT) platform to ensure a great user experience, but have the code that drives that experience in the right places in your application following the MVVM pattern. In this course you will learn how to do that by learning how to leverage the Microsoft patterns and practices guidance &quot;Prism for Windows Runtime&quot; directly from a member of the Prism team. You will learn how to separate your Pages into Views and ViewModels following the MVVM pattern and integrate nicely with the WinRT navigation system and application lifecycle of suspend/terminate/resume. You&#39;ll learn how to manage dependencies and communicate between loosely coupled components in your application. You will see how to validate user input, both on the client side and through service calls to a back end, as well as how to display those errors to the user. You learn how to call Web API services and how to do simple authentication and authorization with those services. Finally you will learn how to leverage Windows Runtime platform features including Search charm, Settings charm flyout panels, and Live Tiles.">Building Windows Store Business Apps with Prism</a>

In this course we learn how to work with application data, that is, working data that is created and accessed by your app on a continuous basis. Traditionally, app data has been local, but Metro blurs the distinction between local and remote data by making things such as cloud storage and app-to-app integration an integral part of both the user and developer experiences. This course looks at accessing files, local and remote, as a content source for our apps; it explores app data storage and roaming as well as the settings contract; and it takes an in-depth look at app-to-app sharing through the sharing contract. Before doing so, however, it starts with a fresh look at the UI side of things, including Metro controls and data binding. After watching this course, you should feel comfortable accessing, listing, updating, roaming and sharing data in your metro apps.">Windows 8 Metro Application Data</a>

And finally we take a serious look at the push notification architecture, and the way push features can light up our app, for example by leveraging tile and toast updates to it.

Inside, you&#39;ll find gems like a pub sub system, short-lifetime queues, and full authentication integration with Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, and Windows Live.">Windows Azure AppFabric</a>

Accessing the Windows Azure platform from Windows Phone applications makes for unlimited possibilities for developers. However, working with Azure from a device comes with challenges, such as dealing with HTTP-based communication and access control. The Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone was created by people from Microsoft to simplify make mobile cloud scenarios for Windows Phone developers, through a set of services and tools that greatly facilitate performing common tasks involved in working with Azure tables, blobs and queues. This course, takes an in-depth and hands-on look at leveraging Azure storage services from a Windows Phone application, by exploring and building on top of the toolkit. Along the way, we introduce each of the Azure storage types, and we learn about the programming interfaces they expose and how to work with them directly and through the toolkit’s architecture.">Building Windows Phone Applications with Azure</a>

Data binding allows you to keep your XAML UI definition loosely coupled from the logic and data access that gets data into the application that will be used for display purposes. You can use data binding to build rich, interactive, beautifully designed user interfaces that are driven by data of many types. In this course you will learn how to leverage all the features of data binding and will learn enough to feel comfortable tackling everything from simple to complex data binding scenarios. You&#39;ll learn about what kinds of data sources you can work with, all the features that the Bindings themselves support, and how to use DataTemplates to provide a custom, reusable XAML rendering of your data objects. You&#39;ll learn how to use design time features in Visual Studio to generate data bound UIs or hook up existing ones, and you&#39;ll learn how to use the validation features to validate input data and present errors to the user. Along the way, you&#39;ll see some demos that use the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern and others that do not so you can see the power of data binding regardless of the UI patterns that you follow.">WPF Data Binding in Depth</a>

Did you know there is LINQ to XML that allows you to process XML documents quickly and efficiently? If the answer is no to either of these two questions, then you need to watch this course. XML files are very common in today&#39;s programming world. You will most likely need to read files, write files and query XML within your applications. .NET provides a rich set of XML processing classes that you can use to perform all these functions. C# allows you to easily create, read and query XML files using XPath, LINQ to XML and other methods. In this course you will learn to read and write XML files using the various .NET classes. You will see some real-world uses of XML files in applications.">The Many Approaches to XML Processing in .NET Applications</a>
